# VaDE Model Summary

Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE) [1] is an unsupervised generative clustering
approach based on Variational Autoencoders [2]. 

In this library, VaDE can be deployed as a deep clustering model using both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for the encoder ***(x,φ)*** and the decoder ***f(z,θ)***. 

The encoder learns to compress the high-dimensional input images ***x*** into lower-dimensional latent representations ***z***.

Using a Mixture-of-Gaussians (MOG) prior distribution for the latent representations ***z***, we examine
sub-groups or domains within the dataset, revealed by the individual Gaussians within the learned 
latent space, and how ***z*** affects the generation of ***x***. 

The model can be used to perform inference, where observed images ***x*** are mapped to a series of corresponding 
latent variables ***z*** and their cluster/domain assignments ***c***.

We denote the latent space dimensionality by ***d*** (i.e., ***z ∈ R^d***), and the number of 
clusters by ***D*** (i.e., ***c ∈ {1, 2, ..., D}***).

The decoder CNN generates images ***x*** from latent space samples ***z***.
Thus, the trained decoder CNN can also be used to generate synthetic images from the algorithmically identified subgroups.
VaDE is optimized using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes cite{kingmaAutoEncodingVariationalBayes2013} to maximize
a statistical measure called the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).


# CDVaDE Model  Summary 

In this package, we also implement the Conditionally Decoded Variational Deep Embedding (CDVaDE) model [4] as an expansion to VaDE.
CDVaDE's generative process is different from VaDE's because it combines extra variables 
***y*** with the latent representation ***z***, as shown in the Figure below.
These variables may include class labels or existing subgroup structures 
that do not need to be identified by the clustering algorithm.
It is expected that these additional variables ***y*** are accessible during both
 training and testing.

# DEC Model Summary 

Deep Embedding Clustering (DEC) [3] is a method of unsupervised learning that combines deep neural networks with clustering 
techniques to discover latent representations of data points.
DEC involves training a deep neural 
network to learn a lower-dimensional representation of the data, and simultaneously optimizing a clustering loss function to group similar 
data points based on their embeddings. 

# M2YD Model Summary

The M2YD model is implemented as an experimental method, which combines an unsupervised VAE-based clustering neural network with simultaneous training of a neural network for a supervised classification task.
At the current stage, the method/model is purely experimental (with limited validation), and thus not recommended for practical use, unless you know exactly what you are doing.
