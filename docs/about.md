# VaDE Model Summary

Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE) cite{jiang2016variational} is an unsupervised generative clustering
approach based on Variational Autoencoders cite{kingmaAutoEncodingVariationalBayes2013}. 

In this library, VaDE can be deployed as a deep clustering model using both Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for the encoder *g(x,phi)* and the decoder *f(z,theta)*. 

The encoder learns to compress the high-dimensional input images *x* into lower-dimensional latent representations *z*.

Using a Mixture-of-Gaussians (MOG) prior distribution for the latent representations *z*, we examine
sub-groups or domains within the dataset, revealed by the individual Gaussians within the learned 
latent space, and how *z* affects the generation of *x*. 

The model can be used to perform inference, where observed images *x* are mapped to a series of corresponding 
latent variables *z* and their cluster/domain assignments *c*.

We denote the latent space dimensionality by *d* (i.e., *z in R^d*), and the number of 
clusters by *D* (i.e., *c in {1, 2, ..., D}*).

The decoder CNN generates images *x* from latent space samples *z*.
Thus, the trained decoder CNN can also be used to generate synthetic images from the algorithmically identified subgroups.
VaDE is optimized using Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes cite{kingmaAutoEncodingVariationalBayes2013} to maximize
a statistical measure called the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).
