About DomID
===============

The Variational Deep Embedding (VaDE) model is trained to learn lower-dimensional representations of images based on a Mixture-of-Gaussians latent space prior distribution while optimizing cluster assignments. In this package, examples on multiple dataset has been presented.

DomainLab
==============
DomainLab is a submodule that has been used to develop DomID, and it aims at learning domain invariant features by utilizing data from multiple domains so the learned feature can generalize to new unseen domains.

Loading a Datasets and Defining a Task
=======================================
Running the code with the custom dataset entails initialization of a Task and a Dataset. Examples of each for both HER2 and MNIST are included. More could be found in the sections below.

Composition and Defining a Model
==================================

Model is built from the building blocks in domid/compos directory. However, the model for the experiment is defined in the domid/models. For more details, see below.
